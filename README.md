# James Ruffini

I am a hard-working and motivated aspiring Developer, with experience working in Operations in Financial Services, and IT Support; while also having an additional background in Physics and Environmental Science. I enjoy working effectively as part of a team, which has been key in my previous roles and lab work at university.

I am currently learning to code and expanding my knowledge of the tech industry as a whole at Makers Academy, taking part in a 12 week software development bootcamp.

My IT skills include proficiency and daily use of Microsoft Office, Bloomberg, Salesforce, and programming skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript and MATLAB. Along with my primary language of English, I can speak Italian at an intermediate level.

## Skills

#### Strong communication

By working at many different roles in various sized companies - I believe I have been able to develop very strong communication skills. Much of my most recent role involved constant communication with clients to maintain and build upon existing relatioinships - and my strong communication skills there in allowed service desk requests to be resolved smoothly.

#### Fast Learner & Ability to Self Teach

I have always found myself to be quick to learn new things and adapt to new situations. During my role at the Independent Research Forum, due to the nature of the company, I found myself moved between projects very often and was kept on my toes. Being able to learn fast and grasp understandings of new company processes and technologies that I had not previously been exposed to led to a stronger work performance in comparision to others placed in similar situations. An example of this being when I was tasked to head up designing and crafting email templates; while I didn't have any prior experience with design or HTML and CSS, I was able to self teach and adapt to produce a solid end result.

#### Problem Solving

My problem solving skills were tested at their peak during my time at university - where many of my modules were highly analytical and problem based. While I believe I have always possessed mathematical and logical thinking skills, they were further developed and refined more so here. More specifically, during my final dissertation - where very little was given in the way of guidance of how to achieve outcomes based on the initial hypothesis.
