# James Ruffini

I am a hard-working and motivated aspiring Developer, with experience working in Operations in Financial Services, and IT Support; while also having an additional background in Physics and Environmental Science. I enjoy working effectively as part of a team, which has been key in my previous roles and lab work at university.

I am currently learning to code and expanding my knowledge of the tech industry as a whole at Makers Academy, taking part in a 12 week software development bootcamp.

My IT skills include proficiency and daily use of Microsoft Office, Bloomberg, Salesforce, and programming skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript and MATLAB. Along with my primary language of English, I can speak Italian at an intermediate level.
